<p><b>ENVY, VAINGLORY, SLOTH, AVARICE (GREED), ANGER, GLUTTONY AND LUST.</b> Throughout the centuries these have come to be known as the seven deadly sins. Why these seven? They are singled out because they promise us the kind of fulfillment only God can deliver on. They have a way of taking something good, God-given even, and twisting them into vices that turn us away from the One we were made to find our rest and completion in.</p>

<p><b>Envy</b> takes the beauty of our diversity and turns it into a source of resentment. <b>Vainglory</b> makes an obsession of our natural need for recognition. <b>Sloth</b> elevates comfort into a perpetual state of inertia. <b>Avarice</b> makes an idol out of self-sufficiency. <b>Anger</b> distorts the noble pursuit of justice into a crusade for personal vengeance. <b>Gluttony</b> replaces spiritual nourishment with physical satiation. <b>Lust</b> divorces sexual pleasure from a relationship of love and mutual self-giving.</p>

<p>Why are these sins considered deadly? The answer begins with the recognition that we are finite creatures built with a longing for an infinite God. What happens when we try to fill an infinite longing with a finite good? We end up going back for more and more and more. The desire just gets deeper and grows more restless because it cannot be satisfied with the thing we're trying to satisfy it with. It is an ugly downward spiral.</p>

<p>In the end, what we see is that all these sins are rooted in <b>Pride</b>, the granddaddy of them all--the foolish belief that we can find happiness on our own terms apart from God. Pride is the ultimate source that nourishes all seven of the deadly sins. And so as we look at envy, vainglory, sloth, avarice, anger, gluttony, and lust, we will also be reflecting on how each is rooted in the original sin of Pride.</p>
