<p>On the Christian calendar, Lent marks the <b>40 days</b> leading up to Easter Sunday. Throughout Scripture, the number 40 carries a heavy significance. In the days of Noah God sent rain on the earth for 40 days and 40 nights. Then, after God delivered Israel out of Egypt, they wandered in the desert for 40 years before entering into the Promised Land. Moses spent 40 days on Mount Sinai with God, writing on tablets the words of the covenant. Jesus fasted for 40 days in the wilderness, before he began his public ministry.</p>

<p>What we see is that the number 40 in the Bible symbolizes a period of preparation, which is what Lent is. It is a season where we prepare ourselves to enter into the very heart of the Christian faith: the death and resurrection of Christ. We reflect on our need for a Savior. We take time to acknowledge that we are at fault in Jesus' death. We do this so that we can better remember the love of our God who sent his only Son to die on a cross for us.</p>

<p><b>ON A SIDE NOTE:</b> Sundays are excluded from the 40 days of Lent (meaning Lent is technically 46 days if we count Sundays), since Sunday is always a celebration of Christ's resurrection. It is why the early Christians decided to gather on Sundays to worship (instead of the traditional Saturday), because they believed it was important to mark each week by celebrating the resurrection of Christ.</p>
