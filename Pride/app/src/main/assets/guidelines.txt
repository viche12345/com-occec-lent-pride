<p>Each week, we will be reflecting on one of the seven sins, asking how that sin may be present in our own lives.<p>

<p>The weekly reflections all include 3 parts: <b>(1)</b> A list of symptoms along with a brief synopsis of each sin. <b>(2)</b> An explanation of how each sin is rooted in PRIDE and a devotional to ground our understanding in Scripture. <b>(3)</b> A few suggestions to help us pray, as well as some things we can do to "put to death" each sin. <b>(4)</b> A devotional for families with little children.</p>

<p>The point of all this is not simply to make us feel bad, though it is of course important to recognize how we may be falling short in following Jesus. Ultimately, we hope that reflecting on our sins may open our eyes to the grace we have been shown through Jesus, and to how we might live more faithful lives of obedience.</p>

<p>We ask that you approach each reflection with a posture of openness. Perhaps, on first read, you don't think that particular sin is really present in your life. Even if this is the case, we ask that you continue to ask yourself honestly how that sin might be subtly influencing your thoughts, words, or deeds, and that you would listen attentively to what the Spirit may have to speak to you.</p>

<p>Though these devotionals are meant to lead to individual reflection, some of the most valuable examination we do comes from sharing about our walks in Christ with each other. We know doing this can be scary. But we encourage you to make space in your weekly fellowship meetings, after Sunday services, or even by meeting up during the week, to share and reflect about what God may be revealing to you. This is also a great way for families to do their devotionals together.</p>

<p>We are excited to see what God will do in and through us as we journey through this season together!</p>
